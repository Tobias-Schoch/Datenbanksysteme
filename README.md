## 📦 The Project

This is a project created at the University of Applied Science HTWG Konstanz in the class Datenmbanksysteme. 
Its about creating a Database for a platform like AirBnB. 
In the first task we have to plan and evaluate things like ER-Diagramm, Accessmatrix, Boyce-Codd, Use-Case and a Preview on a website.
<br>
In the other tasks we have to setup data in the database, sort them in tables and make select commands.
Furthermore we give different people different access modes.
In the last task we implement the database in a java application.
<br>
If you want to evaluate or continue the project, just fork it.
